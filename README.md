# Workshop on AI and Large Language Models in Psych/JDM Research

We will be exploring how to use AI in our data analysis pipeline. 

For this workshop, I have set up several examples to work with, canvassing different possibilities. You are welcome to change the code to suit your purposes. 

## Requirements

Minimal understanding of programming required. This repository is intended to be an accessible starting point to non-experts.

Google Drive

Google Colaboratory -- To check whether you have this, see if you can choose it as an option for creating a new document in the online Google Drive interface (New > More), otherwise click "Connect More Apps".

### Optional
If you wish to run the entire script for the second file, you need an OpenAI platform account; should come with $5 sign on bonus. It will not run if you don't have any money on the platform. 

## Usage
Download the ZIP file of this repository (top right, green button that says Code), and drop the files into your Google Drive, in a place where you can easily find it.

Please start by opening scripts folder, and click on the text-insights...ipynb script file. At this point, you should be in the Google Colaboratory environment.

By pressing the "play" button next to each bit of code, you can run the Python code, and it will usually present you with some output.

After you get comfortable, try out the translate-and-code...ipynb script.

### Data Protection
If you change the code and use some of your own data, note that Google Colab is connected to Google servers and that if you use the OpenAI API, you will be sending your data to them.

The HuggingFace models work differently - you load the model into your RAM and pass it requests.
